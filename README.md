# BenchFlow

*Repeatable LLM inference benchmarks for OpenShift.*

> [!NOTE]
> This project is experimental and for learning purposes mainly, but the implemented execution paths today are `llm-d` and `RHOAI`. Expect some parts to still be highly coupled.

BenchFlow is a packaged control plane for running benchmark scenarios, not a loose collection of scripts. It resolves an experiment into one immutable `RunPlan`, executes it through Tekton `PipelineRun`s, captures metrics and artifacts, and pushes the result to MLflow. It is powered by [vllm-project/guidellm](https://github.com/vllm-project/guidellm).

> [!WARNING]
> BenchFlow does not yet implement a cluster-level lock for shared platform setup. Until that exists, let each benchmark job run end to end before launching another one that mutates the cluster, or use one matrix experiment so BenchFlow can queue and run multiple combinations through Kueue with controlled parallelism.

## Quickstart

Install the CLI from the repository root:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Before bootstrapping, create the real secret manifests next to the examples under `config/cluster/secrets/`. BenchFlow applies every `*.yaml` file there except `*.example.yaml`, so `cp` the examples secrets and remove the `.example` suffix, and populate them with your credentials.

BenchFlow supports two cluster topologies.

### Single cluster

```bash
bflow bootstrap --single-cluster
bflow experiment run experiments/smoke/qwen3-06b-llm-d-smoke.yaml
```

BenchFlow installs Tekton, Kueue, the BenchFlow remote-capacity controller, Grafana, RBAC, GPU prerequisites, and the required PVCs in the same cluster. Kueue admits runs locally against the discovered GPU capacity, and Tekton runs the full workflow there.

### Management cluster + remote target cluster(s)

Management cluster:

```bash
bflow bootstrap
```

Target cluster(s):

```bash
bflow bootstrap --target-kubeconfig ~/.kube/target-cluster --cluster-name target-cluster
```

Run from the management cluster:

```bash
bflow experiment run experiments/smoke/qwen3-06b-llm-d-smoke.yaml --cluster-name target-cluster
```

In this mode, the management cluster runs Tekton, Kueue, and the BenchFlow remote-capacity controller. Kueue queues executions by target cluster and admits them only when the target has enough GPU capacity. The target cluster does not need Tekton; BenchFlow launches the runtime work there through plain Kubernetes `Job`s using the stored kubeconfig Secret.

The narrow path is the shipped smoke experiment:

```bash
bflow experiment run experiments/smoke/qwen3-06b-llm-d-smoke.yaml
```

Then follow the execution:

```bash
bflow watch <execution-name> --namespace benchflow
```

BenchFlow also supports matrix experiments by turning one or more profile fields into lists; the cluster then runs the cartesian product through child executions. `rhoai` child executions can be admitted in parallel when target-cluster GPU capacity allows it, while `llm-d` child executions are submitted sequentially because the upstream GAIE deployment still creates shared namespaced resources that collide across parallel child deployments. Once the parent has submitted child executions, canceling the parent is only best-effort; already queued or running children may need individual cancellation.

For the full command surface, RunPlan PipelineRun flow, matrix execution, and lower-level runtime commands, see [docs/ADVANCED.md](docs/ADVANCED.md).

## Known Limitations

- BenchFlow does not yet implement a cluster-level lock for shared platform setup and teardown, so concurrent mutating runs can still race on shared cluster state.
- `llm-d` matrix children run sequentially today because the upstream GAIE deployment still creates shared namespaced resources that collide across parallel child deployments.
- Matrix parent cancellation is best-effort after child executions have already been submitted; queued or running children may need to be cancelled individually.
- Kueue only gates GPU capacity and start order. It does not replace mutation safety for shared platform resources.
